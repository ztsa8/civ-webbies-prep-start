# User Profile Rendering Project - Zaneta Tsang

This project demonstrates a progressive enhancement of a JavaScript-based user profile viewer using [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io) and modular JavaScript. The app evolves from a static HTML rendering of one user profile to a responsive, card-based dashboard of multiple users deployed via GitHub Pages.

## Project Stages

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| v1      | Static rendering of one user using hardcoded template literals |
| v2      | Modular layout using Bulma sections and card elements |
| v3      | Introduces helper functions (`formatCurrency`, `formatDate`) |
| v4      | Renders multiple users via `forEach()` with full detail |
| v5      | Uses ES modules to import `users.js` dataset |
| v6      | Grid layout dashboard for all users with card summaries |

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The app is deployed automatically on push to the `main` branch via GitHub Actions.

To deploy:

1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions runs the `deploy.yml` workflow.
3. GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the GitHub Actions artifact.

Live site:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
```

## Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
```

### 2. Add and commit changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 3. Push to GitHub
